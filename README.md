    </div>
    <div class="lg-card-content">

## acknowledgments

- Inspired by Apple's design language and iOS/macOS interfaces
- I did not want to use WebGL / any other 3d rendering library/ framework for simplicity and accessibility
- Built with modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript


Made with ❤️ by Jvalaj for the web. Inspired by Apple's beautiful design language.
